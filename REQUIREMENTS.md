# Medical Biochemistry Lab Management System - Requirements

## Project Overview

This application is designed for a medical biochemistry lab to streamline patient data management and bloodwork result processing.

## Current Pain Points

The doctor currently uses a folder-based system to store patient information and bloodwork requirements, then manually transfers this data to legacy software for result generation. This process creates significant workflow friction.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Eliminate Double Work

- **Problem**: Currently requires writing down important information and then manually transferring it to software
- **Solution**: Create a unified system that captures all necessary information in one place, eliminating the need for duplicate data entry

### 2. Remote Access & Validation

- **Problem**: Doctor is physically tied to the lab location for result validation
- **Requirements**:
  - Lab technicians can upload results to the application
  - Doctor can edit and validate results remotely from any location
  - Mobile-friendly interface for phone access
  - Support for multiple workplace locations

### 3. Improved Information Access

- **Problem**: Difficulty finding past bloodwork results and identifying incomplete results
- **Requirements**:
  - Fast search and retrieval of historical bloodwork data
  - Clear identification of incomplete or pending results
  - Improved visibility into result status and completion times
  - Better organization of patient data for quick reference

### 4. Passwordless Authentication

- **Problem**: Password management is difficult for staff - passwords are frequently lost
- **Requirements**:
  - Passwordless login system for lab staff
  - Secure authentication method that doesn't rely on traditional passwords
  - Easy access for authorized personnel only
  - System designed for internal lab staff use (no external patient access required)

## Success Criteria

- Reduced time spent on administrative tasks
- Increased flexibility for remote work
- Improved data accessibility and searchability
- Streamlined workflow from data entry to result delivery
- Simplified authentication process for staff
